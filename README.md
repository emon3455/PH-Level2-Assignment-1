# What are some differences between interfaces and types in TypeScript?

TypeScript is a powerful superset of JavaScript that helps developers write safer, more predictable code by adding types. In this blog post, we’ll explore the key difference between: **Interfaces** and **Types**

## 1. Interfaces vs Types in TypeScript

Both **interfaces** and **types** in TypeScript serve a similar purpose — to define the shape or structure of data. However, there are some key differences between them.

### Interfaces:
- **Declaration merging**: One of the unique features of interfaces is their ability to merge multiple declarations. If you declare the same interface more than once, TypeScript will combine all of them. This is helpful when working with third-party libraries, where you might want to extend an existing interface.
- **Extending other interfaces**: Interfaces are designed to be extended easily. You can extend an interface by using the `extends` keyword, allowing you to create more specialized versions of an interface.
  
    ```typescript
    interface Animal {
      name: string;
    }

    interface Dog extends Animal {
      breed: string;
    }

    const myDog: Dog = {
      name: "Millu",
      breed: "German Shepherd",
    };
    ```

### Types:
- **Union and intersection**: Types are more flexible and allow for defining unions (one of several types) or intersections (a combination of types).
- **Cannot be merged**: Unlike interfaces, types cannot be declared more than once. If you try to declare the same type multiple times, TypeScript will throw an error.
  
    ```typescript
    type Animal = {
      name: string;
    };

    type Dog = Animal & {
      breed: string;
    };

    const myDog: Dog = {
      name: "Jemy",
      breed: "German Shepherd",
    };
    ```

#### Key Differences:
- **Interfaces** are more suited for defining object shapes and class implementations, and they support declaration merging and extension.
- **Types**, on the other hand, are more flexible and can be used for creating unions, intersections, or primitive types.

While you can often use them interchangeably, knowing when to use which can make your code more readable and easier to maintain.
